# Quick How To
I've uploaded the runnable jar into root directory. I know it's obviously a big no-no to do this on a code repo, but loads of people want to get this running without programming know how. Any way, download the PriemBot.jar file, place in a directory and run:

java -jar PrimeBot.jar

and it will give you the help.
